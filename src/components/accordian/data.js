      answer:
        "Therefore, fabrics and cloths assembled by tailoring and dressmaking are considered synonyms for textiles. In the textile process, natural and synthetic raw materials like Fibers, dyes, chemicals, etc. are considered the primary ingredients. Fibers are measured as fundamental components of the clotting process.",
